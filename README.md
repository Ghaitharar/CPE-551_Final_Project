# CPE-551_Final_Project
Abstractâ€”We analyze the statistical relations between Etherurm cryptocurrency Ether value and the tweets posted on Twitter mentioning Ethereum. We use TWINT - Twitter Intelligence
Tool to scrap tweets since a given date to current date at the time of execution. Then we use Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library to perform Sentiment Analysis on tweets. We perform some statistical analysis to study the relationship between the score of the tweets and the change of the cryptocurrency value. This project could be the core for larger and more advance application.

Introduction:
Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the platform. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, after Bitcoin. Ethereum is the most actively used blockchain. Studying the statistical relation between social media and Ether value could be useful given the high volatility of cryptocurrincies.
